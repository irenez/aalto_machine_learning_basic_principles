Exercise 6.1

Download the Auto-MPG data. Find the two first principal com-
ponents, project the data onto them, and plot the data along them.
Compute the amount of variance explained by the two first compo-
nents.


Exercise 6.2

(b) Experiment with kmeans algorithm on kmeans data 1.txt (from
course web-page) and cluster the points using kmeans implementa-
tion in Matlab (or any other implementation) with k = 2. Run the
algorithm using different choices for the initial centroids. What do
you observe? Why does this happen?

(c) We have already talked about model selection in the previous prob-
lem sessions. In case of clustering the question is how to select
k, i.e., what is the correct number of clusters. Experiment with
kmeans data 2.txt data set and run your algorithm on it with dif-
ferent k. Plot the error E as a function of k. Can you find from the
graph what a good choice for k would be?
