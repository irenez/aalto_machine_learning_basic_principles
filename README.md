Exercise 3

The owner of a ski shop must order skis for the upcoming season. Orders
must be placed in quantities of 25 pairs of skis. The cost per pair of
skis is $50 if 25 are ordered, $45 if 50 are ordered, and $40 if 75 are
ordered. The skis will be sold at $75 per pair. Any skis left over at the
end of the year can be sold (for sure) at $25 a pair. If the owner runs
out of skis during the season, he will suffer a loss of “goodwill”‘among
unsatisfied customers. He rates this loss at $5 per unsatisfied customer.
For simplicity, the owner feels that demand for the skis will be 30, 40,
50 or 60 pair of skis, with probabilities 0.2, 0.4, 0.2 and 0.2 respectively.
What should be his optimum decision?
